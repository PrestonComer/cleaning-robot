# Cleaning Robot AI

This project is to refresh myself on basic artificial intelligence ideas by having an unintelligent cleaning robot clean an environment that does not present an impossibility such as a blocked corner.

### The Environment
The space that the robot will have to clean can be occupied by a couple  different things: "Dirt", "Empty", "Object", or the "Robot" itself.

### Movement
The robot is only possible of 4 different movements either 'Up', 'Right', 'Down', or 'Left'. There might be the addition of the diagonal directions being added in the future but as of the intial development it will remain those 4.
